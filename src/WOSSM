Wizards Only Super Secret Manual
================================

To see if a player is a wizard, in MUF, regardless of their Quell bit, use
  '"truewizard" flag?'

A room set BOUND (Builder) cannot be exited by using personal actions.
  You can still use 'home' there, though.

Setting the log_programs @tune will let you log the text of a program
whenever it gets saved in the editor.  This is useful for finding people
who are uploading illegal programs, using them, then immediately recycling
them to escape detection.
