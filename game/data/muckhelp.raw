Welcome to NeverDark.

  This is a fork of fbmuck, which is GPL'd work. I've worked on a noise
algorithm before this, and this is an attempt to share it, as a sort of
online CV experience. I've always delayed sharing the code because of my
deep, deep shame.

  So I just keep working on it, how much do I mean this? Well, I've made
this in a way u hopefully don't notice when I build.

  Room positions are 3D, but terrain is 2D. How big is the world?
2^16. Is there only one? No. 2^16. How many biomes? Actually 13,
counting with Jesus. Gots some combat, spells, bufs, etc.

  It is quite pre-alpha but I'll keep working on it when I can.

  Check out the code at https://github.com/tty-pt/neverdark

  I have removed the @ from all commands.

Thanks and have fun.

whisper
WHISPER <player>=<message>

  Whispers the message to the named person, if they are in the same room
as you.  No one else can see the message.  Wizards can use the form
'whisper *<player>=<message>' to whisper to players in other rooms.
  Note: Most systems use a MUF program with a global 'whisper' action, which
takes the place of the built-in 'whisper' command, and has more features.
~~alsosee say,pose,page
~
~
drop
DROP <thing>

  Drops the <thing> if you are holding it.  It moves the thing to the room
you are in, unless the thing's STICKY flag is set, or the room has a
drop-to.

  If the thing's STICKY flag is set, it will go home when dropped.

  If the room's drop-to is set, and the room has it's STICKY flag set,
then the thing will stick around in the room until all players have left.
If the room is not set sticky, then the thing will be sent to the location
given by the room's drop-to.

  You can also drop programs, much like things, but they are not affected
by room droptos or STICKY flags.

  An '@drop' message can be set which will be shown to the player dropping
the object, and an '@odrop' message can be set, which will be shown to the
other players in the room.  Throw and put can be used instead of drop.
~~alsosee @drop,@odrop,@lock,STICKY,DROP-TO,get,put
~
~
home
HOME

  Sends you home, no matter where you are. You retain your pennies, but
any objects you are carrying leave your inventory and return to their own
homes. See HOMES.
~
~
rob
ROB <player>
  Attempts to steal one penny from <player>. The only thing you can rob
are pennies.
~~alsosee robbery
~
~
robbery
Robbery:

  When you rob someone, you succeed or fail to use them.  You can protect
yourself from being robbed by entering "@lock me=me". If you lock yourself
to yourself, you can rob yourself and set off your @success and @osuccess
messages.

~~alsosee rob,success,failure,@lock
~
~
c|cast
c<number>

  Casts the spell in the <number> slot.

~~alsosee spells,walk,kill,combo
~
~
0|combo
<number>

  Each living thing has a list of 8 (0-7) spells it can use during combat,
and also a mask that indicates which of those spells will be attempted
during the next turns. This is called the combo.

  For example, if you have Fireball in spell slot 0, and you type in "1",
Fireball will be cast next turn, as long as you have enough mana. If you
have "Fire Focus" in slot 2 and you type in "5", you select both spells.

~~alsosee kill,walk
~
~
examine
EXAMINE <object>[=proppattern]
  
  If you do not control <object>, it prints the owner of the object.
  
  If you control <object>, examine will give you a complete breakdown of
all standard fields, flags, etc that are associated with the object.
MPI in the the displayed fields will be shown raw, without executing it.
  
  If the optional proppattern field is supplied, then it instead lists
out all the properties that matches the given wildcard pattern.  If the
pattern ends with '/' then all the sub-properties in the matching propdirs
will be listed.  If the pattern ends with **, then all sub-propdirs of
the matching properties will be shown recursively.
  
~~code
  ex obj=/        list all root properties on obj.
  ex obj=/**      list ALL properties on obj.
  ex obj=foo/     list all properties in the foo propdir on obj.
  ex obj=foo/**   list all props in the foo/ propdir, and all contained dirs.
  ex obj=foo*bar  list root props whose name start with foo and end with bar.
~~endcode

help
HELP [<subject>]

  With no arguments, this command returns a brief summary of basic
commands on playing the game. When <subject> is specified, it returns
detailed informaion on that topic.  Lists of topics are available by
typing 'help category', or 'help alpha'.  Seeing as you are reading this,
you probably already understand how this works.
~
~
walk|walking
Walking
[<number>]<direction>

  Moves you in the specified direction. They are:

Dir	Keys

West	  h
South	  j
North	n k
East	e l
Up	u K
Down	  J

  For example, if you wanted to move north you could just type "n", or
if you wanted to move 2 tiles north and 1 east, you could type "2ne".

  Some characters are missing from the table, right?

  Though you can still type "west" or "down" to move in these directions,
It must be followed by return / enter, and not have anything preceding it.

  This is because these characters are reserved for other operations.
These, like walking, and contrary to other commands, can be typed
one after the other. Just like in VI's NORMAL MODE.
You can learn more about them in the help pages listed below.

~~alsosee dir,geo,kill
~
~
dir|directional|dir_op|dir op
<op>[<number>]<direction>

  The available operations are r, R, d, D, w and W.

  For example, you can make a door to your north by typing "dn",
or make two parallel doors to your north with "d2n".

~~alsosee r,R,d,D,w,W,walking,geo,kill
~

types
Object Types:

  There are 5 types of objects:
Players are the objects users log in as; their avatars.
Things are objects that can be carried, or that can sit about a room.
Rooms are locations that contain players and things and linked exits.
Exits are the means by which players move between rooms.
Programs are player-written extensions to the game.

  The first letter following an object's ID number indicates the type:
P(layer), E(xit), F(orth program), or R(oom).  Otherwise it's a Thing.
~
~
objectmatching|object_matching|object matching
Referring to Objects:

  You can specify objects (things, players, exits, and rooms) by name if
they're in your inventory or in the same room as you. You need only type
enough letters of the name to be unambiguous. You can also specify objects
anywhere by their DBRef, in the form #<dbrefnumber>. Players in other rooms
may be specified in the form *<player name>. The keywords 'me' can be used
for yourself, and 'here' for the room you're in.

  Each object has an ID number (the 'dbref'), which appears after the
name of the object, and is followed by any flags on the object; Ie:
Foo(#3672PB) is a Player, named Foo, set BUILDER.  The number is a
database reference, and is used to specify objects at a distance;
Ie. 'examine #3672'. You will only see the ID number of objects you
own, or which are set LINK_OK, ABODE, or CHOWN_OK. Wizards can see the
numbers and flags on all objects.
~~alsosee flags,types,ABODE,CHOWN_OK,LINK_OK
~
~
control
Control:

There are 3 rules to controlling objects:
~~code
  1) You control anything you own.
  2) A wizard or God controls everything.
  3) If Realms_Control is @tuned on in the server, then if a player owns an
     environmental room, and that room has it's Wizard bit set, then the owner
     of that environment room has control over anything contained in that env-
     ironment room.  This includes things inside of rooms that are inside of
     that environment room, and so forth.  Everything in that Wizbit environ-
     ment can be controlled by the environment's owner. 
~~endcode
  
There are a few things to keep in mind, in relation to the above:
~~code
  a) Anybody can @chown an unlinked exit to themselves, even if it is locked.
     Builders should beware of this, lest their exits be linked or stolen.
     Once the object has been chowned, then it will be controlled by the
     owner, as per rule 1.
  b) Players can @chown to themselves any exits which are linked to an object
     they own.  Note Rule #1.
  c) Players can @chown to themselves any exits which are attached to an object
     that they own.  Note Rule #1.
  d) If an object is set CHOWN_OK, anyone may "@chown <object>=me" and gain
     ownership and control of the object. (see chown_ok)
~~endcode
~
~
@describe|@desc
@DESCRIBE <object> [=<text>]

  Sets the description field of <object> to <text>.  If <text> is not
specified, the description field is cleared.  This is the same as
'@set <object>=_/de:[text]' A description is what is seen when a
player looks at something.
~
~
substitutions|pronouns|pronoun_subst|pronoun substitution|%a|%s|%o|%p|%r|%n
Pronoun Substitutions:

  @osuccess, @ofail, and @odrop messages may contain %-substitutions,
which evaluate to gender-specific pronouns if the player's 'sex' property
is set. These substitutions are:
~~code
    %a (absolute)       = Name's, his, hers, its.
    %s (subjective)     = Name, he, she, it.
    %o (objective)      = Name, him, her, it.
    %p (possessive)     = Name's, his, her, its.
    %r (reflexive)      = Name, himself, herself, itself.
    %n (player's name)  = Name.
~~endcode
Capitalized pronouns are also available with %A, %S, %O, %P, and %R.
If you need a '%', use %%.
  
  The naturally supported genders are 'male', 'female', 'neuter', 'herm',
and 'hermaphrodite', with the last two being equivalent, both using the
sie/hir/hirself/hirs pronoun set.
 
This set of supported genders can be extended either on an individual
player, or globally by adding _pronouns/GENDER/%X properties on the
player, or on #0 respectively.  For example, to add support on yourself
for a 'stallion' gender, you would add five properties, one for each
of the %a, %s, %o, %p, and %r pronouns, in the _pronouns/stallion/
propdir.  Ie:
~~code
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%a:his
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%s:he
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%o:him
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%p:his
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%r:himself
~~endcode

If a shapeshifting player decided that they prefer a different subjective
pronoun for themselve while they were in herm form, they could override it
with something like:
    @set me=_pronouns/herm/%s:shi
This would only override the %s pronoun while their gender was 'herm',
though, meaning that if they shapeshift to male, they only have to change
their 'sex' property, and not tweak their pronouns as well.
  
If a player sets a %a, %s, %o, %p, or %r property on themselve, that value
WILL be used, instead of any matching _pronouns/GENDER/%X property.  This
lets players make quick temporary pronoun fixes, and is also available
for legacy reasons.
  
Ex. '@ofail teapot=burns %p hand on the hot teapot.'
~~alsosee gender
~
~
homes
Homes:

  Every thing or player has a home. This is where things go when they
are sent home, or things with the STICKY flag set go when dropped.
Homes are set with the @link command.  A thing's home defaults to the
room where it was created, if you control that room, or your home.
You can link an exit to send players home (with their inventory) with
~~code
    @link <exit>=home
~~endcode
Drop-tos can also be set to 'home'. @teleport accepts home as an argument,
so you can @teleport things (and players if you are a wizard) to their home.
~~alsosee @teleport,@link,STICKY,drop-tos
~
~
drop-to
Drop-to:

  When the @link command is used on a room, it sets a drop-to location.  Any
object dropped in the room (if it isn't STICKY) will go to that location. If
the room is STICKY, the drop-to will be delayed until the last person in the
room has left.
~
~
@teleport
@TELEPORT <arg1> [=<destination>]

  Moves <arg1> to <destination>, if <destination> is not given, moves you
to <arg1>.  Wizards may teleport anything to anywhere, provided it makes
sense, and mortals are allowed to do two things: teleport rooms to change
their parent fields, and the may teleport things to a room they can link
to, provided they control either the thing or its location.
~
~
timestamps
Timestamps:

  Every object has a timestamp, which includes the time last used, the
time last modified, the time the object was created, and the number
of times that that object has been used by a player. They are shown by
using EXAMINE. 'Usage' is defined as follows: Players-when they are
connected, Rooms-when entered or 'look'd at, Exits-when invoked (by a
'go' command) or 'look'd at, Things-when 'look'd at or 'take'n/'drop'd,
Programs-when run by a player. Examining an object does not count as
looking at them.
~
~
@find
@FIND [<name>] [= <flags/types> = [<output type>]]

  Searches through the database for items that you control matching <name>.
Players control only objects they own; wizards control all objects, so @find
searches the entire database when they use it.  Because the command is
computationally expensive, this costs 100 pennies.
  
  Flags or types can be specified, to specify that you only want to list
objects that have that flag set, or that are of that type.  You can also
specify to list objects that are NOT of that specific type, or that do
NOT have that flag.  (A "!" before the modifier indicates that it is to
be inverted.)
  
The flags that you can specify are:  (use the initial capitalized letter only)
  Abode, Builder/Block, Chown_ok, Dark/Debug, Haven, Interactive, Jump_ok,
  Kill_ok, Link_ok, Mucker, Quell, Sticky/Silent, Vehicle, Wizard, Xforcible,
  and Zombie.
  
You can also specify Mucker Levels by the level number: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  
The types that you can specify are: (use the capitalized letter only)
  Exit, muF program, Garbage, Player, Room, and Thing.
  
There are a few other modifiers you can specify: (use only initial character)
  Unlinked   will specify that you want to list only unlinked objects.
  @          specifies to list objects longer than about 90 days old.
  ~size      will match all objs whose current memory usage is greater than
               or equal to size bytes.  This must be the last modifier in the
               list of modifiers.
  ^size      will match all objs whose total memory usage, when fully loaded,
               is greater than size bytes.  To do this, it loads the entire
               object into memory from disk.  This modifier is only available
               to wizards.  For regular players, this acts like ~size.  This
               must be the last modifier in the list of modifiers.
  
The output types that can be given are owners, links, size, count, & location.
  (You use the whole name for output type, and you can use only one at a time.)
  owners    lists who owns each object.
  links     shows what each object is linked to, or *UNLINKED*, or, for exits
              linked to multiple things, *METALINK*
  size      displays how much memory is currently being used by an object.  If
              this option is used with the ^ modifier, (see above) then this
              will display the true full size of the object, and not just how
              much is currently being used.
  count     causes nothing to be shown but how many objects the @find/etc would
              match.  ie:  it doesn't display any of the matched objects.
  location  shows where the object is located at.
  
The matching on names is as follows:
        Individual words can be matched as {word1|word2|...}
        Individual characters can be matched as [abc...]
        A ? matches any character.
        A * matches any number of characters, including none.
        Any of these special charcters can be matched by putting a \ before it.
  
Examples of use:
    "@find north = EU = location" will find all of your unlinked exits named
        "north" and print them along with their locations.
    "@find {big|little} = R!L" finds all your rooms whose names contain "big"
        or "little" and are not LINK_OK.
    "@find w[ei]ll" will find everything you control whose name contains "will"
        or "well."
    "@find =E=links" will list all exits that you control, and display where
        they are linked to.
    "@find button==locations" will list all objects you control with 'button'
        in the name, and it will display where thay are located at.
    "@find =~2000=size" will list all your objects whose current memory usage
        is 2000 bytes or more, and it will display their size.
    "@find =^2000=size" will, for a wizard, find all objects in the db that are
        2000 or more bytes in total size, when fully loaded, and it will show
        their sizes.  Note that this will load all of each object into memory
        to make the size determination.  On some systems this can take a while,
        and on all systems this is an abuse to the diskbasing cache.  Only
        Wizards may use this search feature.
  
~~alsosee @owned,@entrances,@contents
~
~
@owned
@OWNED <name> [= <flags/types> = [<output type>]]

  Searches through the database for items that <name> controls.
  
  For an explanation of the flags/types modifiers and the output types,
see the help entry for @FIND.
  
Example:  @owned Revar=F!L3=location
  Will list all Mucker Level 3 (3) programs (F) owned by revar, that are
NOT set Link_OK (!L), and it will show the location of each one.
  
Note that only wizards can do an @owned on other people.
~~alsosee @entrances,@find,@contents
~
~
@contents
@CONTENTS [<object>] [= <flags/types> = [<output type>]]

  Searches the given object for items & exits that match the given flag string.
  
  For an explanation of the flags/types modifiers and the output types, see
the help entry for @FIND.
  
Example:  @contents here=DE=owner
  Will list all Dark Exits who's source is your current location, giving the
owner of each one.
~~alsosee @find,@owned,@entrances
~
~
DARK
@SET here=D

  If a room is DARK, then when people besides the owner 'look' there, they only
see things they own. If a thing or player is DARK, then "look" does not list
that object in the room's Contents:. Players can set rooms they own dark, and
may also set objects they own dark, but they cannot drop dark objects in rooms
they don't control. Wizards can set players dark.
When a program is set DARK, it is called DEBUG, and a running stack trace is
printed out to any users of the program for each instruction executes.
~
~
flags
The flags are displayed as letters following an object's ID number.
Flags are set with the @set command. The flags are: W(izard), S(ticky),
L(ink_OK), D(ark), J(ump_OK), K(ill_OK), C(hown_OK), H(aven), A(bode),
B(uilder), V(ehicle), Z(ombie), and The flags R(oom), E(xit), and
P(layer) are also used.  Debug is the same flag as Dark, Silent as Sticky,
Color as Chown_OK, and Bound as Builder.  F refers to a Muck Forth program.
An M followed by a 1, 2, or 3 gives the Mucker Level.  (Priority Level for
exits.) See TYPES, GENDER, and individual flag names.
~
~
HAVEN
@SET here=H

  If a room is HAVEN, you cannot kill in that room. If a player is set
HAVEN, he cannot be paged. (see page) HAVEN, when set on a program is
called HARDUID, and causes that program to run with the permissions of
the owner of the trigger, rather than with the permissions of the user
of the program.  When this is set in conjunction with the STICKY (SETUID)
flag on a program, and the program is owned by a wizard, then it will run
with the effective mucker level and permissions of the calling program.
If the caller was not a program, or the current program is NOT owned by
a wizard, then it runs with SETUID permissions.
~
~
mucker|mucker levels|nucker|0|1|2|3|ML0|ML1|ML2|ML3|priority levels
Mucker Levels:

  The mucker level of a player or program specifies whether or not a player
can make MUF programs, and what permissions they will have when the programs
are run.  (See 'man mucker levels')  Only a wizard may set the mucker level
of a player, and a normal player may only set the mucker level of programs
they own to less than their current mucker level.  A program cannot be set
to mucker level 0, since it doesn't mean anything.
  
  When the mucker level of an exit is set, is it called the exit's priority
level.  The priority levels let you specify that certain exits are not
overidable by local actions.  When an exit is searched for, in the
matching routines, it will match like it used to, except that if it finds
an exit, later in the search order, that has a higher priority level, it
will choose that exit instead.
  
  You can set the priority level of an exit by setting its Mucker Level.
(ie: @set exit=2)  A level of 0 is the lowest priority, and a level of 3
is the highest priority.  Only a Wizard can set the priority level of an
action or exit.
  
  When the server looks for the standard "connect", "disconnect", or "look"
actions, it will ignore any actions with a priority Level of 0.  When an
action is @attached to another object, @named to something else, or
@unlinked, its Priority Level is reset to 0.
  
  If COMPATIBLE_PRIORITIES is #defined on your system, then exits that are
on room or player objects will never act as if they have an effective
priority level of less than 1.
~
~
WIZARD
@SET <thing>=W

  If a person is WIZARD, they are a wizard, unkillable, subject to fewer
restrictions, and able to use wizard commands. It is only meaningful for
players and programs. In general, WIZARDs can do anything using #<number>
or *<player>.
~
~
ZOMBIE
@SET <thing>=Z

  @force and the FORCE muf primitive can be used on objects of type
THING, if they have the ZOMBIE flag set.  Objects act as if they
have the permissions of their owner.  If an object is locked against
a player, it will also be locked against anything that that player
owns, that tries to test the lock.
  
 Things with the ZOMBIE flag set cannot enter rooms or use exits that
have the ZOMBIE flag set.  This allows a way to prevent zombies from
entering areas where they are not wanted.
  
 If you try to run a program that you control, that has its ZOMBIE flag
set, it will drop you into the MUF debugger.  This lets you step line
by line, or instruction by instruction through a muf program, setting
breakpoints to stop at, and other nice things.  There is help available
within the debugger, via the 'help' command.
